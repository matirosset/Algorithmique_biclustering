Description: Biclustering algorithms written in different languages : R and Rcpp. We also provide a simulation file evaluating the time complexity of these algorithms and a result file with examples on binary matrices. The three available algorithms are BiMax (only in R), Bibit (only in R) and iBBiG (in R and Rcpp).
